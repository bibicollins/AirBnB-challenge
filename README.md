This app let's user list their spaces and view spaces listed by others.

## User Stories  

1. Any signed-up user can list a new space.  

        As a New User
        So I can list my flat
        I would like to sign up to Makers BnB  

        As a Signed up User
        So I can list my flat
        I want to login to Makers BnB  

        As a Signed up User
        So nobody else can use my account
        I would like to log out  

        As a Logged in User
        So I can make some money
        I would like to list my space

2. Users can list multiple spaces.   

        As a Logged in User
        I want to make more money
        I would like to list multiple spaces

3. Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.  

        As a User
        So people can find my space
        I want to be able give my space a name  

        As a User
        So people can know how much they are paying
        I want to be able show the price per day of my space  

        As a User
        So people know what they are booking
        I want to be able give my space some description ( Location, Rooms, Size)

4. Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.

        As a User
        So people know when they can stay at my space
        I would like to select the dates that my space is available  
5. Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.  

        As a User
        So I can rent a place for one night
        I would like to make a request  

___________________

6. Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space  

        As a User
        So I donâ€™t book a place that is already booked
        I want to book places that available  

        As an Owner
        So I can avoid double bookings
        I would like to the ability to automatically
        update when I confirm the booking  

7. Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.  


        As an Owner
        So I can confirm the booking
        I would like to approve the request
